# Clustering-Mall-Customer-Segmentation-
- Customer Segmentation is the subdivision of a market into discrete customer groups that share similar characteristics. 
- Customer Segmentation can be a powerful means to identify unsatisfied customer needs. Using the above data companies can then outperform the competition 
by developing uniquely appealing products and services.
* In this project, my team will preprocess, discover data and use 3 clustering algorithms ( KMean, AGNES and DBSCAN ) to cluster this dataset.
